Camperbot is learning how to code too and needs some help with their HTML.

In this lab, you will help Camperbot find and fix the errors in their code.

Debug Camperbot's Profile Page
Camperbot just started learning how to code and is trying to build a profile page. They asked a friend to look over their code so far and their friend said it had tons of errors.

Your job is to fix all of Camperbot's errors so they can continue to build their profile page. Complete the items in the user stories below and click "Run the Tests" to see if you fixed all the errors.

User Stories:

1.  Camperbot is not following best practices and has multiple h1 elements on the page. Remove all h1 elements except for the first one.
2.  Camperbot is trying to use a heading2 element. But that element does not exist in HTML. Fix that mistake so it uses the correct second level heading element.
3.  Camperbot is trying to add some paragraphs but is using the wrong element. Fix these errors to use the correct HTML element for paragraphs.
4.  Camperbot is using an h3 element for the Background and Interests subheading but it has a syntax error. Spot the issue and resolve it.
